## What is BMI (Body Mass Index)?

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated from a person's weight and height. It's commonly used as an indicator of whether a person's weight is within a healthy range relative to their height. BMI provides a rough estimate of body fat and can help identify potential health risks associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese. The BMI value is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The resulting value is then categorized into different ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese, each with associated health implications. However, it's important to note that BMI has limitations and doesn't directly measure body composition or factors like muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat. Therefore, while BMI can be a useful initial assessment tool, it's recommended to consider additional factors and consult a health care professional for a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's health.
